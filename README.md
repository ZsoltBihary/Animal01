### üß† Core Concepts

| Category                      | Description                                                                                                    |                                                                  
| ----------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| **Value-Based**               | Learns the value of being in a certain state (e.g., `V(s)`), often used in dynamic programming and TD methods. |                                                                
| **Action-Value (Q-learning)** | Learns the expected reward of taking action `a` in state `s`, denoted as `Q(s, a)`.                            |                                                                  
| **Policy-Based**              | Learns a policy function directly that maps states to actions without using a value function.                  |
| **Temporal Difference (TD)**  | Updates estimates based partly on other learned estimates.                                                     |                                                                  
| **Actor‚ÄìCritic**              | Combines value and policy learning using separate structures: an actor (policy) and a critic (value function). |                                                                  
| **Model-Based RL**            | Learns a model of the environment to plan and improve learning efficiency (e.g., MuZero).                      |
